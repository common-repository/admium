Admium lets users sign up for recurring subscriptions to your WordPress site, and lets you make subscriber-only content.

== Description ==

Admium lets you sell subscriptions to your site and offer perks to subscribers, such as removing ads or providing subscriber-only content. We process subscription payments for you, take a 30% cut, and pay out the rest of your earnings in a monthly lump sum.

= Offering Subscriptions =

Admium gives you a [admium_subscribe_link] shortcode to use anywhere you want to offer subscriptions. It launches a popup in which users subscribe and pay without ever leaving your site.

= Perks =

While you can use Admium subscriptions simply as recurring donations, we recommend offering some perk to encourage your visitors to subscribe.

Admium supports a variety of perks:

* **Removing Ads for Subscribers** Admium provides Subscriber-only and Nonsubscriber-only versions of the Text Widget, which you can use to remove ads for your subscribers.
* **Subscriber-only Posts and Pages** Admium lets you restrict Posts and Pages to Subscribers-only.
* **Other Perks** Want Admium to help you offer another perk? [Email us](mailto:support@admium.net) your suggestions!

== Installation ==

Upload the Admium plugin to your site, activate it, then you'll be guided through the rest of the setup process with built-in instructions.
